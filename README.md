## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a master's degree in software engineering and have been a full-stack developer since 2015. As a big crypto enthusiast, I decided to fully focus on blockchain development. I already have big experience with Smart Contract and dApps creation where most of them were built using Ethereum(public or private network). I am a great team player and takes time understanding projects and delivering in them in the best way.

Skills: Blockchain / Smart Contact / solidity / REACT / Django / Laravel 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Blockchain/smart contract 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning solana and rust
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love art.
