## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been developing websites and web applications for all of my adult life. I also have extensive knowledge  of front-end JavaScript and browser APIs as well as significant experience with popular frameworks and libraries like React and Redux. I have deep full-stack experience includes Node.js and Express, MongoDB as well as more traditional technologies like PHP, ASP.NET and MySQL and I'm familiar with Laravel and Django. I appreciate the importance of quality code as well as the need to meet scheduling demands.
